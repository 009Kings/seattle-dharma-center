      <h2>Schedule</h2>
      <p>Our monthly meetings are held in the Garden Room at Epiphany Parish (1805 38th Ave, Seattle WA 98122).</p>
      <p><em>Parking at Epiphany:</em> All the streets around the parish are available for parking, there is also a lot across the street on Howell Ave. From Howell, take the red brick stairs, the garden room is on the left.</p>
      <p>Please consider giving $10 donation to help pay for the room rental. Dana (donation) to the teacher is optional and super awesome for visiting teachers; there will be envelopes to put dana in and katas to give it with. The amount you give is not as relevant as the spirit (gratitude/ devotion) in which you give it. </p>
